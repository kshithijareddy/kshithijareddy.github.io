<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p class="about-content">I was born and raised in Bangalore, one of India’s most beautiful cities. I am pursuing a Master’s program in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago. I am working with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/" target="_blank">Dr. Nick Feamster</a> and <a href="https://mollyow.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Molly Offer-Westort</a> on building chatbots to persuade people to vote on critical societal issues like gun control, women’s reproductive rights, and advancing LGBTQ+ equality. My current interest is in studying misinformation on private channels like messaging apps and building effective behavioral interventions to tackle misinformation-sharing. I primarily employ Bayesian modeling (adaptive experimental design), Natural language analysis, Causal Inference, and Network theory in my field experiments and analysis design. My research focus is on the intersection of building infrastructure, mathematical modelling, and Social Science Theory about collective human behaviour. 
</br></br> In what seems like a previous life, I was an Embedded Software Engineer. I launched a startup, was part of the University Hyperloop team that made it to the SpaceX finals in 2017, was a Lead Engineer at a Home automation startup, and was a Senior Software Engineer at Bosch, building safety critical features for vehicles.</p>
